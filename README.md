# SwiftUI-2-CoreData-MVVM-URLSession-DataTaskPublisher
> A ready-to-use SwiftUI Clean MVVM to use when creating a new project including Core Data, a generic type of data source for your ViewModels, a customizable ViewModelDataSource protocol and a standard App Configuration.


This template is intended to reduce the amount of time it takes to create and setup a new project with SwiftUI. 

It includes a sample project that contains:
* A clean MVVM Design Architecture (Model - View - ViewModel) with a subfolder for each category,
* CoreData setup,
  * an example Item and its extension for custom methods and computed properties,
* Sample views using Core Data objects as data source, in a List and Detail View
  * CatListView
  * CatDetailView

Feel free to clone this and to reuse it!

XCode 12, target iOS 13
## Installation



```sh
git clone https://github.com/irfankhatik/SwiftUI-2-CoreData-MVVM-URLSession-DataTaskPublisher
```

Then, rename the project as you wish and start having fun! You can leave it as is, or rename/delete the existing objects.
